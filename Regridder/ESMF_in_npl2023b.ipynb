      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    ESMPy is a Python interface to the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) \n",
      "    regridding utility. ESMF is software for\n",
      "    building and coupling weather, climate, and related models. ESMF has a robust,\n",
      "    parallel and scalable remapping package, used to generate remapping weights.\n",
      "    It can handle a wide variety of grids and options: logically rectangular grids,\n",
      "    unstructured meshes and sets of unconnected points; regional or global grids;\n",
      "    2D or 3D; and pole and masking options. ESMF also has capabilities to read grid\n",
      "    information from NetCDF files in a variety of formats, including the\n",
      "    `Climate and Forecast (CF) V1.6 (a.k.a GridSpec) <http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.html>`_,\n",
      "    `UGRID <https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions>`_,\n",
      "    ESMF Unstructured and SCRIP conventions. Information on these last two conventions\n",
      "    can be found in the\n",
      "    `ESMF Reference Manual <http://earthsystemmodeling.org/docs/release/latest/ESMF_refdoc/>`_.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    ESMPy provides a :class:`~esmpy.api.grid.Grid` to represent single-tile logically\n",
      "    rectangular coordinate data, a :class:`~esmpy.api.mesh.Mesh` for unstructured \n",
      "    coordinates, and a :class:`~esmpy.api.locstream.LocStream` for collections of\n",
      "    unconnected points like observational data streams.\n",
      "    ESMPy supports bilinear, nearest neighbor, higher order patch recovery, \n",
      "    first-order conservative and second-order conservative regridding. There is \n",
      "    also an option to ignore unmapped destination points, mask out points on either\n",
      "    the source or destination, choose straight line or great circle paths when using\n",
      "    spherical coordinates and extrapolate data to points outside of the destination\n",
      "    domain. Regridding on the sphere takes place in 3D Cartesian space, so the pole\n",
      "    problem is not an issue as it commonly is with many Earth system grid remapping\n",
      "    softwares. :class:`~esmpy.api.grid.Grid` and :class:`~esmpy.api.mesh.Mesh` \n",
      "    objects can be created in 2D or 3D space, and 3D conservative regridding is \n",
      "    fully supported.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Regridding, also called remapping or interpolation, is the process of changing\n",
      "    the grid underneath field data values while preserving the qualities of the\n",
      "    original data. Different kinds of transformations are appropriate for\n",
      "    different problems. Regridding may be needed when communicating data between\n",
      "    Earth system modeling components such as land and atmosphere, or between\n",
      "    different data sets to support analysis or visualization.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Regridding can be broken into two stages. The first stage is generation of an\n",
      "    interpolation weight matrix that describes how points in the source grid\n",
      "    contribute to points in the destination grid. The second stage is the\n",
      "    multiplication of values on the source grid by the interpolation weight matrix\n",
      "    to produce the appropriate values on the destination grid. ESMPy provides\n",
      "    access to both stages through two separate interfaces.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    There are many different interpolation methods, suitable for different problems.\n",
      "    In ESMPy, the basic bilinear option is a two dimensional variant of linear \n",
      "    interpolation. The higher order patch recovery is a second degree polynomial \n",
      "    regridding method, which uses a least squares algorithm to calculate the \n",
      "    polynomial. This method gives better derivatives in the resulting destination \n",
      "    field than the bilinear. There are two nearest-neighbor methods which map the \n",
      "    points from one grid to the nearest corresponding point on the other grid, from\n",
      "    either source to destination or vice versa. These are useful for extrapolation \n",
      "    or categorical fields. \n",
      "    \n",
      "    The first-order conservative regridding is a method designed to preserve the \n",
      "    integral of the field across the interpolation from source to destination.  It \n",
      "    uses the proportion of the area of the overlapping source and destination cells\n",
      "    to determine appropriate weights. The second-order conservative method also \n",
      "    preserves the integral, but uses the source gradient to give a smoother result \n",
      "    than the first-order conservative. All of these methods can be broken down to a\n",
      "    simple sparse matrix multiplication operation between interpolation weights and\n",
      "    data values.\n",
